# pg but spelt wrong

A small ping clone written in Go. Written for the 2020 Cloudflare Summer Internship.

Currently only supports IPv4; VirtualBox does not like IPv6 on wireless adapters.
This program is written for both IPv4/IPv6; I have no way to test it however.

Flags implemented are TTL and number of pings to send.
